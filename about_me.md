## About Me

Currently based in London, I am a software developer for the Travel Publishing company [Lonely Planet](http://www.lonelyplanet.com).

I am passionate about learning new programming languages, software disciplines and technologies, and applying this to build software that is efficient, simple, and scalable. 

I enjoy working within vibrant, energetic environments, where the pursuit of writing beautiful software and delivering success products is a collaborative and enjoyable experience.

Languages and technologies I work with on a daily basis include:

* Ruby
* Ruby on Rails, Rack, Sinatra
* Lua
* Nginx
* ElasticSearch
* Amazon Web Services
* Content delivery networks & application integration
* MemCached
* Redis
* Postgresql
* OpenResty
* Jenkins/Hudson
* Chef
* Unix
* Git source control management
* Ruby based tempting engines (Erb, Haml, Slim, Mustache)
* Web markups and languages (JavaScript, CoffeeScript, CSS, HTML)

My interests away from the keyboard include Cycling, Swimming, Films, Music and Reading.
